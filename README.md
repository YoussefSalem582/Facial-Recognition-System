# Facial Recognition System

## Overview
This project implements a facial recognition system using AI-based authentication/identification via images/video for security and access control applications. The system utilizes transfer learning with models like FaceNet and VGG-Face, optimized for low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and real-time performance.

## Features
- Face detection and recognition from images and video
- Transfer learning using pre-trained models (FaceNet/VGG-Face)
- Optimized for real-time performance and low FAR
- Processed datasets including LFW and VGGFace with face detection and augmentation
- MLOps implementation for scalability

## Project Structure
- `facial_recognition_app/`: Main application code
- `faces_train/`: Training dataset
- `faces_test/`: Testing dataset
- `faces/`: Sample face images
- `embedder.py`: Face embedding generation
- `handler.py`: Request handling logic
